This project was created for ENGO 551 Lab 0.

By Utilizing HTML and using CSS I was able to complete and style a personal webpage.
I used various HTML, CSS and SCSS elements.

For each webpage I used:
A designated stylesheet file.
Class selectors
CSS properties.

I also used SCSS' varibale, nesting and inheritance. 
The #id selector was used to create colours for the webpage.
and the media query was used in index.html to ensure it can be viewed on different screens.
