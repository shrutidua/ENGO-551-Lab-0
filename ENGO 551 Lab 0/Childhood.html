<h1> My Childhood! </h1>
<hr>

<h3>  My name is Shruti Dua and I will share some facts about myself and my childhood: </h3>
<p class="one"> I was born in Punjab, India on March 2, 2000. </p>
<p class="two"> I spent my earlier years in Punjab and moved to Calgary, Canada with my Family when I turned 7. </p>
<p class="one"> Most of my extended Family lives in either Punjab, Australia and Italy. </p>
<p class="two"> I always had a great interest in Motorcycles ever since I was little, so I saved up and bought my first motorcycle in 2019! </p>
<p class="one"> I have always loved helping my parents around the kitchen and now cooking and baking is one of my favourite hobbies. </p>
