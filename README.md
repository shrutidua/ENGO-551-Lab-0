# ENGO-551-Lab-0

This project was created for ENGO 551 Lab 0.

By Utilizing HTML and using CSS I was able to complete and style a personal webpage.
I used various HTML, CSS and SCSS elements.

For each webpage I used:
A designated stylesheet file.
Class selectors
CSS properties.

I also used SCSS' varibale, nesting and inheritance. 
The #id selector was used to create colours for the webpage.
and the media query was used in index.html to ensure it can be viewed on different screens.


Here are the webpages that I used to get images for the Cities.html file:
